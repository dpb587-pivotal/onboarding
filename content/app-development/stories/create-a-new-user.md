Create a new user
### What?
Cloud Foundry uses role-based access control, with each role granting permissions in either an [organization](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/concepts/roles.html#orgs) or an [application space](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/concepts/roles.html#spaces). **[View the types of roles and their abilities](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/concepts/roles.html#roles)**. Without a certain role in an org and space you won't be able to perform specific actions.

### How?
1. Create a new user
`cf create-user some-user some-password`
1. Login as that user
`cf auth some-user some-password`
1.  And view orgs
`cf orgs`

Not much there, huh? By default `some-user` cannot view or perform any actions, so as an admin, you'll have to assign some roles. Log back in as the admin user and update `some-user`'s roles so they can push an application in the onboarding-org / onboarding-space org and space.
1. Login back in as admin
`cf auth admin <your-password>`
1. And give some-user the SpaceDeveloper role for onboarding-org/onboarding-space
`cf set-space-role some-user onboarding-org onboarding-space SpaceDeveloper`

### Expected Result
When logged in as `some-user`, you can see "onboarding-org" in your list of orgs and "onboarding-space" in your list of spaces.
