View your app's environment variables
### What?
Environment variables are the means by which the Cloud Foundry [runtime](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/5466/runtime-environment-rte) communicates with a deployed application about its environment. You can use them too!

### How?
1. Run `cf set-env dora SOME_VAR some-var-value`
1. `cf env dora`

### Expected Result
The cf CLI will show the application's environment variables classified as System-Provided (i.e. `VCAP_APPLICATION`) and User-Provided (including `SOME_VAR`). Running and Staging variables are provided by operators that apply to all applications.
