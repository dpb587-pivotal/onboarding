Install Google Cloud SDK
### What?
You're going to deploy your BOSH Director to [Google Cloud Platform (GCP)](https://cloud.google.com). Although [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is-aws/) was historically Pivotal Cloud Foundry's go-to IAAS, we've decided to migrate as much as possible to  GCP. GCP is significantly cheaper than AWS and managing costs is significantly easierâ€”no more reserved instances! We also have an excellent relationship with GCP PMs and Engineers and can escalate issues directly through our contacts.

The `gcloud` CLI manages authentication, local configuration, developer workflow, and interactions with the Cloud Platform APIs. Download and install the [Google SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk) to get `gcloud`, as you'll need it to `bbl up`.

This is another "fun-sized" story (you know you'll miss them once you hit the 6-hour ones....)

### How?
Follow **[these instructions](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/downloads)** to install Google Cloud SDK on your workstation.

Once you've done that, run `gcloud init` in your terminal.

You should have received an invitation to join a GCP project from your facilitator or ask+cf@pivotal.io. Use your @pivotal.io email address and the name of your assigned project to configure the tool (the project name is in the GCP dashboard menu bar and the URL).

### Expected Result
Run `gcloud version` => "Google Cloud SDK 149.0.0 ..." or higher

Run `gcloud config list` =>
```
[core]
account = your-email@pivotal.io
disable_usage_reporting = False
project = PROJECT_ID

Your active configuration is: [PROJECT_ID]
```
