Entertain yourself during the CF deploy "intermission"
### What?
You have some time to kill while your CF deploys. Keep an eye on it (it could flake out at any moment), but otherwise here's some light reading:

* [How the Cloud Balances its load](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/concepts/overview.html#balances) on the official [overview of Cloud Foundry](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/concepts/overview.html)™
* [PCF Linux Containers Overview by Onsi](https://docs.google.com/a/pivotal.io/document/d/1QNcmQCrHZNAr17ULoYis_sDPNV0X4IUO1grFDBlQdO8/edit?usp=sharing)—I really recommend this one, even if you don't get to it now.
* The [Diego design notes](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/diego-design-notes): a comprehensive, up-to-date, and (most importantly) readable overview of Cloud Foundry components and their interaction. Plus, that diagram (diagram, *so* hot right now).

Some good videos:
* [Pivotal Cloud Foundry Overview with Onsi Fakhouri](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7APZD0me1nU)
* [CF Container to Container Networking with Jay Dunkelberger](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B9Srlx6zCCQtdXVjSG5JZklUYmc/view)
* [Diego Runtime Overview with Eric Malm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv5EpheLLh0)
* [The Illustrated Children's Guide to Kubernetes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ht22ReBjno)

And some basic tutorials, specific to topics you might be wondering about right now:
* [Basic Bash scripting tutorial](http://ryanstutorials.net/bash-scripting-tutorial/)
* [Basic Linux/Bash tutorial](http://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/)
* [Basic Linux Networking reference](http://www.penguintutor.com/linux/basic-network-reference)

### Expected Result
Mastery of the material.

(I'm joking)
