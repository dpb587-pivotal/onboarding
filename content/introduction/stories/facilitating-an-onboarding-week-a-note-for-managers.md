Facilitating an Onboarding Week [a note for managers]
Hi there, facilitators!

This is a reminder to read the **[facilitation documentation](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/onboarding/blob/master/FACILITATING.md)** on GitHub.

It's also a short task list of things you might want to do before Onboarding Week starts. After you've completed the tasks you need to, remove this chore from the backlog. (I cannot make it self-destruct. Sad!)
